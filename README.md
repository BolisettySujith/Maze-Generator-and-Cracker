# Maze-Generator-and-Cracker

A maze is a network of paths and hedges designed as a puzzle through which one has to find a correct way. We can see this type of solving game in Sunday magazines. In this project you need to generate a maze and pass that generated maze to the creacker, we will see the cracking of the maze visualization in a GUI and at the end, it will highlight the correct path to reach the endpoint as an output. So in this project, you can use the BFS algorithm for cracking the maze. You can solve such games by trial and error all the ways in the given maze.

- **Maze Generator:** This is a maze generator which generates a maze.
- **Maze Cracker:** This is a maze cracker which solves the maze using BFS algorithm.

## Setup
- You need to clone the repository to your local system

    ```git clone https://github.com/BolisettySujith/Maze-Generator-and-Cracker```

- Run the mazeFinding.py file in the terminal

    ```python3 mazeFinding.py```

## Output
The output of the maze is a maze image and the path to reach the endpoint.
